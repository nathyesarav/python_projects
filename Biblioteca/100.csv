6,"Explain Ensemble learning. 
In ensemble learning, many base models like classifiers and regressors are generated and  combined together so that they give better results. It is used when we build component  classifiers that are accurate and independent. There are sequential as well as parallel ensemble  methods. "
7,"Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.  
Predictive models have a tradeoff between bias (how well the model fits the data) and variance  (how much the model changes based on changes in the inputs).  
Simpler models are stable (low variance) but they don't get close to the truth (high bias).  More complex models are more prone to overfitting (high variance) but they are expressive  enough to get close to the truth (low bias). The best model for a given problem usually lies  somewhere in the middle. "

13,"Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization. 
L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with  many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a  Laplacean prior to the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior. "

21,"Explain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a common method of topic modeling, or classifying  documents by subject matter.  
LDA is a generative model that represents documents as a mixture of topics that each have  their own probability distribution of possible words.  
The ""Dirichlet"" distribution is simply a distribution of distributions. In LDA, document s are distributions of topics that are distributions of words. "
22,"Explain Principle Component Analysis (PCA).  
PCA is a method for transforming features in a dataset by combining them into uncorrelated  linear combinations.  
These new features, or principal components, sequentially maximize the variance represented  (i.e. the first principal component has the most variance, the second principal component has  the second most, and so on).  
As a result, PCA is useful for dimensionality reduction because you can set an arbitrary  variance cutoff. "

30,"Explain bagging.  
Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble method in which the dataset is first divided  into multiple subsets through resampling.  
Then, each subset is used to train a model, and the final predictions are made through voting or  averaging the component models.  
Bagging is performed in parallel. "

32,Why is Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC) better than raw accuracy as an  out-of-sample evaluation metric
33,What are the advantages and disadvantages of neural networks
34,"Define Precision and Recall.  
Precision  
● Precision is the ratio of several events you can correctly recall to the total number of  events you recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls).  
● Precision = (True Positive) / (True Positive + False Positive)  
Recall  
● A recall is the ratio of a number of events you can recall the number of total events.  ● Recall = (True Positive) / (True Positive + False Negative) "

55,"OLS is to linear regression. The maximum likelihood is logistic regression.  Explain the statement.  
OLS and Maximum likelihood are the methods used by the respective regression methods to  approximate the unknown parameter (coefficient) value. In simple words,  Ordinary least square(OLS) is a method used in linear regression which approximates the  parameters resulting in minimum distance between actual and predicted values. Maximum  Likelihood helps in choosing the values of parameters which maximizes the likelihood that the  parameters are most likely to produce observed data. "

Machine learning is a branch of computer science and a method to implement artificial  intelligence. This technique provides the ability to automatically learn and improve from  experiences without being explicitly programmed.  
Deep learning can be said as a subset of machine learning. It is mainly based on the artificial  neural network where data is taken as an input and the technique makes intuitive decisions  using the artificial neural network. "

84,Differences between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
85,"Steps Needed to Choose the Appropriate Machine Learning Algorithm for  your Classification problem.  
Firstly, you need to have a clear picture of your data, your constraints, and your problems  before heading towards different machine learning algorithms. Secondly, you have to  understand which type and kind of data you have because it plays a primary role in deciding  which algorithm you have to use.  
Following this step is the data categorization step, which is a two-step process – categorizati on by input and categorization by output. The next step is to understand your constraints; that is,  what is your data storage capacity"
86,"Explain Backpropagation in Machine Learning.  
A very important question for your machine learning interview. Backpropagation is the  algorithm for computing artificial neural networks (ANN). It is used by the gradient descent  optimization that exploits the chain rule. By calculating the gradient of the loss function, the  weight of the neurons is adjusted to a certain value. To train a multi-layered neural network is  the prime motivation of backpropagation so that it can learn the appropriate internal  demonstrations. This will help them learn to map any input to its respective output arbitrarily. "
