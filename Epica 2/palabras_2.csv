"*AI stock market prediction* has been gaining ground and we’re all wondering if the new, evolved AI-based algorithms can detect price trends. Are they accurate enough to pick winners or detect which stocks will roar and which might crash?Are they sharp enough to detect a new Corona Virus threat, or a government economic news release for its effect on stock prices?  They could actually program it to see these recurring events and ascribe special meaning to a big threat like the new Omicron Covid variant.  But are they doing important detection like this? That’s a mystery, but the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to detect events, weigh them, and advise on the outfall is definitely valuable.Interest in AI technology, AI software ( ) and AI prediction tools ( ) is growing in response to increasing business costs. Some are using AI marketing software ( ) to create better campaigns. Companies who use AI (AI stocks) anywhere in their business operations are the focus of many stock market investors.

The stock market is a good testing ground for AI given how much historical data is available and how much it’s been studied.In an era of Trump vs Democrat media battles, frequent propaganda releases, trade war events, and computer based trading, the AI stock trading system would certainly have to comb out a lot of distraction. But perhaps AI can figure out Donald Trump?Danel Capital has They’ve created a service that can aid in stock prediction ( ) success. 4 years of research and development has lead to a machine learning algorithm that aids in summarizing all available information that can affect stock prices in one global predictive score, which they call *Smart Score™*.*Danel’s stock forecasting tool* is developed by their Co-Founder ad Chief Technology Officer Guillermo Salas.

"To explore commercial success of Show HN projects, I combined submissions with the CrunchBase data. I joined both datasets by network location. Despite obvious problems with overlapping second-level domains (github.com hosts many Show HN projects, but belongs to a different entity in CrunchBase), most HN projects have individual domains and, therefore, match uniquely.I took a random sample of 10,000 Show HN submissions and sent a request to each associated URL. The servers returned status codes, which I used for dividing Show HN projects into living and dead. I interpreted code 200 as saying that the project still exists and all other codes (301, 404, timeout, and others) indicating a defunct project.Users judge these projects early, and success on Hacker News may help developers decide what to do next with their project. Sometimes they succeed. For example, Stripe and Dropbox started ( ) with Show HN. So how well does the Hacker News community detect future hits?* Projects hosted by GitHub live longer. GitHub maintains old repos for free, and the death rate is naturally smaller. I included this variable to control for this bias. Other free web services (youtube.com, blogspot.com) host few projects, and I ignored them.These results hold across different specifications and estimation procedures (of which I included only the basic model). So a Hacker News reception has good predictive power, estimated around the OLS's R² = 14%.* What about cases when error codes happen due to success, like redirect to a new domain? They don't affect the results. Regression of redirects on the same variables yields insignificant coefficients. The same for other error codes.* Here and there, natural logs helped adjust scores and comments for self-reinforcement effects. Meaning, when a project hits the front page, its score and comments grow faster than justified by the project's quality. Logs reduce this effect for better estimates.----"
