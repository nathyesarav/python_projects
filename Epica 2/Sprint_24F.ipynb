       "[\"*AI stock market prediction* has been gaining ground and we’re all wondering if the new, evolved AI-based algorithms can detect price trends. Are they accurate enough to pick winners or detect which stocks will roar and which might crash?Are they sharp enough to detect a new Corona Virus threat, or a government economic news release for its effect on stock prices?\\xa0 They could actually program it to see these recurring events and ascribe special meaning to a big threat like the new Omicron Covid variant.\\xa0 But are they doing important detection like this? That’s a mystery, but the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to detect events, weigh them, and advise on the outfall is definitely valuable.Interest in AI technology, AI software ( ) and AI prediction tools ( ) is growing in response to increasing business costs. Some are using AI marketing software ( ) to create better campaigns. Companies who use AI (AI stocks) anywhere in their business operations are the focus of many stock market investors. Then there are the *AI stock price prediction tools*.There are at least *3 AI stock market prediction services* reviewed below, which you might want to try out. They aren’t well known and do need to improve their digital marketing ( ) efforts to get in front of tens of millions of individual investors who might like they’re guidance.As investors struggle with volatility, pandemic crashes, political strife, economic changes, finding the best stocks to buy ( ) is a challenge. Often the best long term buys in the markets are the worst performing now. Stocks such as 5G, oil stocks, and Bitcoin have almost crashed during the sell off. And they might again.Could AI prediction tools possibly be better at finding the best growth and cyclical stocks?\\xa0 Is AI the ultimate stock market forecast ( ) tool?\\xa0 Is it all about simple patterns, or is stock prediction ( ) a more sophisticated process involving both investment advisor expertise and AI software insight and real time trading responsiveness?*FinBrain ( #finbrainAI ) , I Know First ( #iknowfirst ) ,* and *Danel Capital* ( #danelcapital ) are a few notable stock picking solutions we look at here.\\xa0 How do these *AI stock forecasting systems* work and how much does it cost to use them?Algorithmic trading has been around for several decades.\\xa0 Some NYC traders approached me 15 years ago about conducting their new machine learning, algorithmic trading (precursor to AI trading) market campaigns. They were way before their time. Much too early.But are these forward thinking solutions still too far ahead of the times, with solutions able to tame the complexities of modern stock trading? We’re not sure, however for a free or low initial price, you can try them out.FinBrain Technologies is the service most traders are interested in.\\xa0 IT offers Artificial Intelligence enabled financial prediction technologies.\\xa0 They serve stock ( ) , commodities, forex and cryptocurrency markets.They use models that learn using artificial neural networks, advanced deep learning algorithms, non-linear data, analyze historic data, deploying self-learning and self-adapting algorithms, study market sentiment factors, and technical indicators to forecast prices.*I Know First’s algorithm* is based on artificial intelligence, machine learning and incorporates elements of artificial neural networks as well as genetic algorithms to model and predict the flow of money between markets.The service monitors\\xa0 more than *10,000* assets on 6 time horizons spanning from 3-days to a year periods within stocks, ETF’s, world indices, gold, currencies, interest rates, and commodities markets.\\xa0 Perhaps this is the tool you need to increase your knowledge of investing and get more out of the latest stock market forecasts ( ) ?*I Know First* claims in a report that it achieved 97% accuracy in its AI based predictions of the SandP 500 ( ) (^GSPC) and Nasdaq ( ) (^IXIC) indices, as well as their respective ETFs (SPY and QQQ).The company said that\\xa0during 2019, its ETF tracking of the S&P 500 was 87% accurate of the time for the 3-month prediction time horizon. They claim they can predict the 3-day time horizon at 65%, 7-day time horizon at 69%, and 14-day time horizon at 79%. They offer online artificial intelligence stock trading accounts starting at $169 per month to $349 per month. At that very low price, it seems worth a try. Check them out here: I Know First ( ).The I Know First’s system seems to be able to ignore stock price volatility to identify underlying trends in historical data. The stock market is a good testing ground for AI given how much historical data is available and how much it’s been studied.In an era of Trump vs Democrat media battles, frequent propaganda releases, trade war events, and computer based trading, the AI stock trading system would certainly have to comb out a lot of distraction. But perhaps AI can figure out Donald Trump?Danel Capital has\\xa0They’ve created a service that can aid in stock prediction ( ) success. 4 years of research and development has lead to a machine learning algorithm that aids in summarizing all available information that can affect stock prices in one global predictive score, which they call *Smart Score™*.*Danel’s stock forecasting tool* is developed by their Co-Founder ad Chief Technology Officer Guillermo Salas. His expertise is in the development of algorithms for the generation and management of big data in the financial industry.And Aarón Román is co-Founder & Chief Data Scientist for *Danel Capital*. He is a an expert in quantitative analysis, specializing in the application of statistical models and numerical techniques to the daily analysis of billions of data of publicly traded companies.The artificial intelligence enhanced firm caters to banks, asset management companies, financial advisors, wealth management firms, hedge fund managers, and online platforms. At this time, I can’t vouch for I Know First’s predictive success as reported by users.\\xa0 But then if it did produce excellent stock market forecasts ( ) , users would want to keep that quiet.I Know First Disclaimer: I Know First-Daily Market Forecast, does not provide personal investment or financial advice to individuals, or act as personal financial, legal, or institutional investment advisors, or individually advocate the purchase or sale of any security or investment or the use of any particular financial strategy.I Know First offers newsletters, reports, and daily stock picks. Leveraging the knowledge and insights of an AI software system might give you a boost in earnings. Visit and Iknowfirst.com ( ) and check it out.You’re going to ask for my picks of AI stock market forecasting tools but I can’t offer one. I think these services are on the right road. Doing any stock market forecast ( ) is extremely challenging given all the international, national, corporate, regulatory, economic, and other trends going on that can affect how governments manipulate the markets.This is why *AI stock prediction tools* have such big challenges to overcome. It’s like AI tools trying to forecast the biggest selling novel in 5 yeras, or the top song or move in 2025. The algorithms are set to past data and are not set to calculate human emotion and market manipulation.Learn more about stock prediction and AI trading algorithms on research.net, If, AI can observe events long enough, and trading and economic data and news events would bring huge amounts of data to bear on stock trading, then it stands to reason it will forecast more accurately ( ).* information contained in this page is offered as information only and is not an endorsement of the services or a recommendation of their stock price prediction services.

       " \"To explore commercial success of Show HN projects, I combined submissions with the CrunchBase data. I joined both datasets by network location. Despite obvious problems with overlapping second-level domains (github.com hosts many Show HN projects, but belongs to a different entity in CrunchBase), most HN projects have individual domains and, therefore, match uniquely.I took a random sample of 10,000 Show HN submissions and sent a request to each associated URL. The servers returned status codes, which I used for dividing Show HN projects into living and dead. I interpreted code 200 as saying that the project still exists and all other codes (301, 404, timeout, and others) indicating a defunct project.Users judge these projects early, and success on Hacker News may help developers decide what to do next with their project. Sometimes they succeed. For example, Stripe and Dropbox started ( ) with Show HN. So how well does the Hacker News community detect future hits?* Projects hosted by GitHub live longer. GitHub maintains old repos for free, and the death rate is naturally smaller. I included this variable to control for this bias. Other free web services (youtube.com, blogspot.com) host few projects, and I ignored them.These results hold across different specifications and estimation procedures (of which I included only the basic model). So a Hacker News reception has good predictive power, estimated around the OLS's R² = 14%.* What about cases when error codes happen due to success, like redirect to a new domain? They don't affect the results. Regression of redirects on the same variables yields insignificant coefficients. The same for other error codes.* Here and there, natural logs helped adjust scores and comments for self-reinforcement effects. Meaning, when a project hits the front page, its score and comments grow faster than justified by the project's quality. Logs reduce this effect for better estimates.----\",\n",
